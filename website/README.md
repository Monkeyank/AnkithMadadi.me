##TODO:
- Finish converting to REACT
- Add some actual text
- Add formspree to contact page
- Add downloadable resume(pdf)
- Edit placeholder images with real images!
- Add resume to the website
- Update .env file
- Update Data
- Update Fun Facts
- Add social Media tags
- Update Colors/Theme

If styling gets weird refer to /static/css/main.scss, cause I changed it to reduce the size of the main layout and add more space for the sidebar to fit!

## Forking Note

If you fork this repo, please change the **form action** to an email address you own before trying it out. [Thanks!]

```
<form action="https://formspree.io/your-email@here.com" method="POST" class="form-horizontal" role="form">
```

Built with React!
